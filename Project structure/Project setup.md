## Repository setup

Ask a Lead Engineer to set up the repository on GitHub. If you're a Lead Engineer, follow the [Repository setup](https://github.com/infinum/LE-wiki/wiki/Repository-setup) guide on the LE wiki.

## Project setup

1. Clone the project repository and open it in Android Studio.
2. Follow the instructions from the TEMPLATE_README.md file (in the root of the project).
3. Create a pull request with the above changes before continuing with the rest of the setup.
4. Set up [CI & code analysis](/books/android/ci-and-code-analysis/continuous-integration).
5. Update minimum, target and compile SDK to the values agreed with the client.
6. Update README.md (see the [Readme](/books/android/building-quality-apps/project-readme) chapter for details). Make sure to keep updating it as you progress with the project.
