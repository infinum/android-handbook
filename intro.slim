        .paragraph__title Introduction
        .paragraph__content Android development has always been very chaotic. There are as many solutions to common issues in Android development as there are developers.
        .paragraph__content To help us with this clutter, we have developed the Android Handbook, a coding standard in which all developers can find something useful for themselves or their team. Having this set of guidelines helps us evolve as a collective, avoiding well-known issues, such as AsyncTask in Activity, variable names in languages other than English, and method names in snake case.
        .paragraph__content This handbook touches on the whole processâ€”from creating a new project, through development and testing, to releasing it on Google Play. It's dangerous to go alone, so read this.
